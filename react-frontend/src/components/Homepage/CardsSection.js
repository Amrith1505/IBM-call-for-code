            <div className="card"><h2>Reuse</h2>Reuse is the action or practice of using an item, whether for its original purpose or to fulfil a different function. It should be distinguished from recycling, which is the breaking down of used items to make raw materials for the manufacture of new products.</div>
            <div className="card"><h2>Recycle</h2>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. The recovery of energy from waste materials is often included in this concept. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had in its original state.</div>
            <div className="card"><h2>Energy consumption</h2>Energy recovery includes any technique or method of minimizing the input of energy to an overall system by the exchange of energy from one sub-system of the overall system with another. The energy can be in any form in either subsystem, but most energy recovery systems exchange thermal energy in either sensible or latent form.</div>
            <div className="card"><h2>Treatment and Disposal</h2>Treatment techniques act to reduce the volume and toxicity of solid waste. These steps can transform it into a more convenient form for disposal. Waste treatment and disposal methods are selected and used based on the form, composition, and quantity of waste materials. </div>
